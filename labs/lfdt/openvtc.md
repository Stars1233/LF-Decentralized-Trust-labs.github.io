# Lab Name

OpenVTC

# Short Description

Reference implementation of the LFDT ToIP Decentralized Trust Graph Working Group specifications for components of a verifiable trust community (VTC).

# Scope of Lab

The [Decentralized Trust Graph Working Group](https://lf-toip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/pages/257785857/Decentralized+Trust+Graph+Working+Group) (DTGWG) at Trust Over IP (ToIP) specifies open standard specifications for building verifiable trust communities (VTCs). VTCs are composed of cryptographically-verifiable trust relationships between the community members, including both people and AI agents. Each relationship is expressed using a verifiable credential (VC) between two or more decentralized identifiers (DIDs). Proofs of these VCs enable: a) individuals to provide privacy-preserving proof of personhood, and b) AI agents (or any digital service) to provide proof of control by an individual or an organization.

Every node in a decentralized trust graph (DTG), including people, AI agents, devices, and VTCs, are represented by a verifiable trust agent (VTA). The DTGWG also specifies protocols for standard VTA trust tasks such as generating VTC invitations, issuing/verifying/revoking DTG VCs, and reading/writing/enforcing VTC governance policies.

The scope of the OpenVTC project includes developer SDKs and reference implementations of the components necessary to implement VTAs and VTCs. The initial target communities are LF open source projects including the Linux kernel, Kubernetes, Open Telemetry, etc.
